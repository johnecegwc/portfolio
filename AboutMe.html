<p>My name is Johnece Thompson. I love watching Youtube videos, laughing, & learning. I would love to travel Earth. It's so many beautiful places in this world. I dislike when people honk their horn, rock my chair, & my dog scratches me. A fun fact about me is that I've never had an F, C, or D on my report card.</p>
